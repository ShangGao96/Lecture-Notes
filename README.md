# Lecture Notes
My lecture notes typed up in LaTeX.
If you feel that I left out something important or just want to contribute to helping students have access to a set of good quality notes, then feel free to make a change. I'll update the pdf files on my website every time a change is made to an existing note.

NOTES NOT YET POSTED:
- CS 251 Lecture 4, Jan. 12th (I need to cover some additional content from our textbook in order to understand what happened today. Will aim to have them up by Jan. 15).

Cheers,

Bartosz
