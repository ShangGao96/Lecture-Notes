# Lecture Notes
My lecture notes typed up in LaTeX.
If you feel that I left out something important or just want to contribute to helping students have access to a set of good quality notes, then feel free to make a change. I'll update the pdf files on my website every time a change is made to an existing note.

NOTES NEEDING A TUNE-UP:
These notes have been uploaded, but the content in them isn't up to the highest standard of note-taking.
- CS 251 Lecture 4 (I was pretty lost in this lecture. At my professor's office hours, he mentioned that everything I wrote down is all we need to know come exam time, but I personally feel that additional content can be added)

Cheers,

Bartosz
